    "### Ans:In Python, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It works with inheritance through method overriding—where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method defined in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "1. **Method Overriding**: A subclass redefines a method from its superclass.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dynamic Dispatch**: Python calls the appropriate method based on the object's type at runtime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Duck Typing**: Polymorphism also works via shared method names (even without inheritance).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Polymorphism in Python leverages inheritance by allowing subclasses to override superclass methods.  \n",
    "  * The correct method is resolved at runtime based on the object's type.  \n",
